Easy load-testing
- What can you do with a single machine that will give you a reasonable payoff?
- Control factors that throw off your data:
    - Use a modern tool like wrk/wrk2 or bombardier (don't use ab)
    - There's a difference between tools meant to generate a lot of load vs tools meant to simulate user behavior
    - Limit resources - don't allow competition between other processes on your machine and your workload
- What to test?
    - Docker/docker-compose makes it easy to test dependencies
    - Mock or use your data dependencies (test is only as good as your mock)
    - Expect to mostly find:
        - Something really bad in your code
        - Misuse of resources
        - Things you thought were cheap are expensive
        - Complex expensive database queries
        - Databases can be complicated to test 
            - you can get different results from production because of caching
            - you can saturate the disk if you're just testing writes
